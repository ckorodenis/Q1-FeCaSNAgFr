Mint NFT by category/parameter

1 - If this ASC is contacted by the owner using his wallet address, private key and the parameter "Fe" or "Ca" or "S" or "N" or "Ag" or "Fr" I want the ASC to output the NFT from the appropriate category according to the type of parameter and the NFT to be output to the player's wallet address which will also be passed to him so we will contact the ASC roughly as follows 

"<ownerwalletaddress> <ownerprivatekey> <parameter> <playerwalletaddress>"  

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Combination Fe; Ca

2 - If any player sends 4 pieces of matching NFTs from the "Fe only" or "Ca only" category to the ASC and the ownership of these NFTs is verified to be owned by our ASC. So the player will have to send either 4 pieces of NFTs of "Fe" or 4 pieces of NFTs of "Ca" category, other combinations are not allowed and will be returned to the player, at the same time they must be NFTs with metadata value Crystals = Stable only. An action will be triggered that will select two of these NFTs and send them to the wallet address for token burning "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000" two pieces of these NFTs will be burned and the remaining two pieces of NFTs will have their value in the Crystals metadata changed from "Stable" to "Reduced", also the reference to the NFT image will be changed from "<NFT number>Stable.jpg" to "<NF numberTReduced. jpg" and then these two NFTs will be returned to the player's wallet and then ASC will automatically punch the same player's wallet with NFTs from the "S" or "N" category depending on what NFTs he provided at the beginning, if 4x from the "Fe" category the "S" NFT will be punched and if 4x from the "Ca" category the "N" NFT will be punched 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Combination S; N

3 - If any player sends 4 pieces of matching NFTs from category "S" or "N" to the ASC and ownership of these NFTs is verified to be owned by our ASC. So the player will have to send either 3 pieces of NFT "S" 1 piece of NFT from category "N" or 2 pieces of NFT "S" 2 pieces of NFT from category "N" , other combinations are not allowed and will be returned to the player, at the same time they must be NFT with metadata value Crystals = Stable only. An action will be triggered that will select two of these NFTs and send them to the wallet address for token burning "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000" so two of these NFTs will be burned and the remaining two NFTs will have their Crystals metadata value changed from "Stable" to "Reduced", also the NFT image reference will be changed from "<NFT number>Stable. jpg" to "<numberNFTReduced.jpg" and then these two NFTs will be returned to the player's wallet and then the ASC will automatically start the same player's wallet with NFTs from the "Ag" or "Fr" category depending on the NFTs he provided at the beginning, if 3x from the "S" category and 1x from the "N" category the "Ag" NFT will be started and if 2x from the "S" category and 2x from the "N" category the "Fr" NFT will be started 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Combination Ag; Fr

4 - If any player sends 3 pieces of matching NFTs from the "Ag" or "Fr" category to the ASC and ownership of these NFTs is verified to be owned by our ASC. So the player will have to send 2 pieces of NFT "Ag" 1 piece of NFT from category "Fr", other combinations are not allowed and will be returned to the player, at the same time it must be NFT with metadata value Crystals = Stable only. An action will be triggered that will select 1 NFT from the "Ag" category and 1 NFT from the "Fr" category and send them to the wallet address for token burning "0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000" so these two NFTs will be burned and the remaining NFT from the "Ag" category will have its Crystals metadata value changed from "Stable" to "Reduced", also the NFT image reference will be changed from "<NFT number>Stable. jpg" to "<numberNFTReduced.jpg" and then this one NFT from the "Ag" category will be returned to the player's wallet, and then ASC will automatically drop an NFT from the "Fe" category on the same player's wallet, but ASC will set the value of Crystals = Unstable in the metadata 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mint CrystalSynthesizer NFT

5 - Anyone who sends exactly 123.45 MAS tokens to the ASC, I want this wallet to immediately fire an NFT of the category "CrystalSynthesizer" with the metadata value Condition = New and then immediately send exactly 123.2 MAS to the wallet address - MW0rldWallet

 if any other amount is sent to the ASC it will be immediately returned to the sender minus 0.8 MAS fees, so if someone sends for example 60 MAS tokens to the ASC they will get exactly 59.2 MAS back.
